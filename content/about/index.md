I'm a full-time Machine Learning Engineer at Hishab Ltd. I earned my bachelor's degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I'm now a part-time Master's student doing speech processing research at the same university.

I carry a wonderful academic career, have published 5 research papers so far in a short period of time, including a journal paper which was published by EURASIP. 

I won awards for my efforts in a number of national and international competitions. The motivation to pursue a career in research in the fields of signal processing and machine learning has grown since attending ICIP 2019, Taiwan, as a finalist in the international competition VIP CUP 2019.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
