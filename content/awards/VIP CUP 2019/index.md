This competition's goal was to recognize human activities at home, work, and sports using a First Person View (FPV) camera. FPV activity detection is crucial for assisted living, activity tracking, and life journaling. Outlier motions (for example, induced by other people seen by the camera), motion blur, shifting illumination, and self-occlusion are the main obstacles to detecting FPV activity.
