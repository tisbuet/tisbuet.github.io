"Unsupervised abnormality detection using intelligent and heterogeneous autonomous systems" was the problem. Our objective was to detect anomalies in the behavior of ground and aerial systems in real time using embedded sensor data. We made every effort to accomplish that. My teammates and I finished 4th in the race. Many thanks to the organizers for putting this tournament together, and congrats to my teammates, without whom it would have been a difficult competition.
